# Red Badge Client
This is the client side of things for my Red Badge project!

# Inpsiration
The idea behind this app was to be able to create a simple application where people can find songs they like, add them to their favorites list, and then add comments
to each individual song! The app also includes User Authentication. In order to access any part of the website, a user must create an account, and then login!
